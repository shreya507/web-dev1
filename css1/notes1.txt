HTML is just an skeletal layout of a website. We need CSS to design a website add styles to it and make it look beautiful.

What is CSS
CSS stands for cascading style sheets
CSS is optional but it converts an off looking HTML page into a beautiful & responsive website

installing VS Code
We will use microsoft visual studio code as a tool to edit our code. It is very powerful, free and customizable.

Why learn CSS?
CSS is a very demanded skill in the world of web development. If you are successfully able to master CSS,
you can customize your website as per your liking.

Your first line of CSS 
create a css file inside your directory and add it to your HTML. Add the following line to your CSS
body{
    background-color: red;
}
This will make your page background is red


                   Chapter-1

We will create our first CSS website in this section.

What is DOM?
DOM stands for document object model. when a page is loaded the browser creates a DOM of the page
which is constructed as a tree of objects.

HTML id and class attributes
when an HTML element is given an id, it serves as a unique identifier for that element.
On the other hand, when an HTML element is given a class, it now belongs to that class. More than one elements
can belong to a single class but every element must have a unique id (if assigned).

We can add multiple classes to an element like this 
<div id="first" class="c1 c2 c3"(multiple classes followed by spaces)>..........</div>

Three ways to add CSS to HTML
1. <style>tag -> Adding <style>.......</style> to HTML
2. Inline CSS -> Adding CSS using style attributes
3. External CSS -> Adding a stylesheet (.css) to html using <link> tag.

CSS Selectors
A CSS selector is used to select an HTML elements for styling.

body{                  ->Selector
    color:red; ->Declaration(property:value)
    background:pink; ->Declaration
}

Element Selectors
It is used to select an element based off the tag name
 for example:
h2{
    color:blue;
}

ID Selectors
It is used to select an element with a given id 
For example:
#first{                   ->#is used to target by id
    color:white;
    background:black;
}

Class Selector
It is used to select an element with a given class
for example:
.red{
    background:red;
}

Important Notes:
-> We can group selectors like this:
h1,h2,h3,div{
    color:blue;      ->h1,h2,h3 and div will be group
}

-> We can use element class as a selector like this:
p.red{
    color:red;       ->all paragraphs of will get color of red
}

* can be used as a universal selector to select all the elements
*{
    margin:0;
    padding:0;
}

An inline style will override external and internal styles

Comments in CSS
comments in css is text which is not parse and is thus ignored
