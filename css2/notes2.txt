Colors & Backgrounds
CSS rules are simple key-value pairs with a selector we can write CSS rules to change color and set backgrounds.

The color property
The CSS color property can be used to set the text color inside an element
p{
    color:red;             ->text color will be changed to red
}
similarly we can set color for different elements

Types of color values
Following are the most commonly used color values in CSS
1. RGB -> Specify color using Red, green, blue values eg. rgb(200,98,70)
2. HEX code -> Specify color using hex code eg. #ff7180
3. HSL -> Specify the color using hsl values eg. hsl(8,90%,63%) ->hue,saturation,lightness

The value of the color or background color is provided as any one of these values.

NOTE: We also have an RGBA and HSLA values for color but they are rarely used by beginners A stands for alpha.

The background-Color property
The CSS background-color property specifies the background color of a container.
For eg:
     brown{
        background-color: brown;     -> can be other types of colors as well
     }

The background-image property
Used to set an image as the background.
body{
    background-image: url('image.jpg');
}
The image is by default repeated in X & Y direction.

The background-repeat property
can be any of:
-> repeat-X = repeat in horizontal direction
-> repeat-Y = repeat in vertical direction
-> no-repeat = do not repeat the image
see more possible values at MDN docs

The background-size property
can be following:
-> cover = fits & no empty space remains
-> contain = fits & image is fully visible
-> auto = Display in original size
-> {{width}} = set width & height will be set automatically
-> {{width}} {{height}} = set width & height manually

NOTE: Always check the MDN docs to dissect a given CSS property. Remember, practice will make you perfect

The background-position property
sets the starting position of a background image.
div1{
    background-position: left top;
}

The background-attachment property
Defines a scrollable/non-scrollable character of a background image.
div2{
    background-attachment: fixed;
}

The background shorthand
A single property to set multiple background properties.
div3{
    background: red url('image.jpg') no-repeat fixed left top;
}
One of the properties can be missing given the others are in order.

The CSS box model looks at all the HTML elements as boxes.
                        margin
                        Border
                        padding
                        Content
        
Setting Width & height
We can set width & height in CSS as follows
#box{
    height: 70px;
    width: 70px;
}
NOTE that the total width/height is calculated as follows:
Total height = height + top/bottom padding + top/bottom border + top/bottom margin
Total width = width + left/right padding + left/right border + left/right margin

Setting margin & padding 
We can set margin and padding as follows:
box{
    margin: 3px;                                                                          Clockwise direction
    padding: 3px;                      (set top, bottom, left, right values)                     top
}
.boxMain{                                                                               left               right
    margin: 7px(top) 0px(right) 2px(bottom) 11px(left);
}
                                                                                                  bottom

.boxLast{
    margin: 7px(top&bottom) 3px(left&right);
}
We can also set individual margins/padding like this:
margin-top: 70px;
margin-bottom: 70px;
margin-left: 70px;
margin-right: 70px;
This is same goes with padding

Setting border
we caan set the border as follows:
.bx{
    border-width: 2px;
    border-style: solid;                  or just set border: 2px solid red;
    border-color: red;                        (shorthand)
}

Border Radius
We can set border radius to create rounded borders
div2{
    border-radius: 10px;
}

Margin Collapse
When two margins from different elements overlap, the equivalent margin is the greater of the two.
This is called margin collapse.
                     |______| margin 3px
                    7px ....... 1-3px            margin between then is collapsed to the bigger margin
                     |______| margin 70px

Box Sizing
Determines what out of padding and border is included in elements 
                     width and height can be content-box or border-box
               Included only content width/height        |
div1{                                                    |
    box-sizing: content-box;                             |
}                   |--------------------> The content width and height includes content + padding + border
