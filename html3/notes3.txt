When we use the right tag in right place, it results in a better page layout, better indexing by search engines and better user experience.
We use the following tag to get the job done.

<header>=>contains nav tag
<main> , <footer> =>website layout
Inside the main tag we insert the following tags:
<main> -> The main opening tag
<section> -> A page section
<article> -> A page article
<aside> -> A page aside
<figure> -> A page figure
<figcaption> -> A page figcaption
</main> -> The main closing tag

creating a page like this is not necessary but it creates a rendered & structured layout.
Also they are useful for SEO.

<a href="/contact" target="_blank">Contact us</a> ->opens in a new tab

If the page is inside a directory, we need to make sure that we link to the correct page. ->some applies to img as well
We can add links to images like this.
