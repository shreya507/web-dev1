             Chapter - 5 Size, position & Lists
There are more units for describing size other than 'px' there are rem, em, vw, vh, percentage etc.

Whats wrong with pixels?
 Pixels (px) are relative to the viewing device. for a device with size 1920 * 1080, 1px is 1 unit out of 1080/1920.

Relative lengths
 These units are relative to the other length property : following are some of the most commonly used relative lenghts.

1.   em -> Unit relative to the parent font size.
                     |_>em means "my parent element's font size"
2.   rem -> Unit relative to the root font size (<html>tag)
3.   vw -> Unit relative to 1% viewport width.
4.   vh -> Unit relative to 1% viewport height.
5.    % -> Unit relative to the parent element

min/max-height/width Property
CSS has a min-height, max-height, min-width and max-width property.
If the content is smaller than the minimum height, minimum height will be applied.
similar is the case with other related properties.

The Position Property
Used to manipulate the location of an element following are the possible values:
-> Static: The default position. Top/bottom/left/right/Z-index has no effect.
-> Relative: The top/bottom/left/right/Z-index will now work. Otherwise the element is in the
 of document like static.
-> Absolute: The element is removed from the flow & is relatively positioned to its first non-static
 ancestor. Top/bottom etc works.
-> Fixed: Just like absolute except the element is positioned relative to the browser window.
-> Sticky: The element is positioned based on user's scroll position.

List-Style Property
The list style property is a shorthand for type, position & image 
ul{
                         |-> List-style position
    list-style: square inside url('oir.jpeg')
                 |_>list-style type     |______________>list-style image
}
Z-index Property 
The Z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.
It defines which layer will be above which in case of overlapping elements.
Y
|
|      Z
|    /                 ==> Z is the third dimension
|  /
|/______________X
