HTML - Hyper text markup language (Skeleton of webpage)
HTML is the language of the web. it is used to create websites. we use HTML tags to define look & feel of a
website with understanding of these tags and how to put them together we can create beautiful websites easily.

Then Why CSS & javascript
HTML is used for defining layout of a page - A parebone page structure.
CSS is used to add styling to that barebone page created using HTML.
Javascript is used to program logic for the page  layout eg:- What happens when a user hovers on a text,
 when to hide or show elements e.t.c.

A Beautiful analogy
HTML:- car body (only metal)
CSS:- car paint, decoration etc.
Javascript:- Car engine + interior logic

We will start learning how to build beautiful layouts in this course.

Installing VS Code
We can use any text editor of our choice. Here I am using VS Code because it is light weight, open source & from Microsoft.
Go to google, type VS Code & install it.

Note: You can write HTML even in Notepad. Text editors like VS Code just makes these things easier.

We start building a website by creating a file named index. html is a special filename which is presented when the website
root address is typed.

A Basic HTML page
<!Doctype html> - Specifies this is an html5 doc5
<html> - Root of an HTML page
<head> - Contains page metadata
<title> - Title of the page
<body> - The main body of the page (rendered by the browser)
</body> - End of the body tag
<h1> - This is a heading </h1> - heading tag
<p> My Paragraph </p> - paragraph tag
</html> - End of the HTML tag

A tag is like a container for either content or other HTML tags.

HTML DOCUMENT => BROWSER => RENDERED page
IMPORTANT NOTES
Head & body tags are children of HTML tag.
HTML is the parent of head & body tags.
Most of the HTML elements have opening & closing tag content in between opening & closing tags.
Some HTML tags have no content. There are called empty elements eg <br>
We can either use htm or html extension
You can use "inspect element" or "view page source" option from chrome to look into a websites's HTML code.
HTML element = start tag + content +end tag

Comments in HTML 
comments in HTML are used to most text which should not be parsed. They can help document the source code.
<!-- HTML comment -->
 Case Sensitivity
 HTML is a case insensitive language. This means that <p> and <P> are same. <H1> and <h1> tags are same.


 We can add elements inside the body tag is to define the page element.



 HTML Elements
 Everything from starting to the ending tag
 <body> => Opening tag
 -> Content <-
 </body> => Closing tag
 HTML ATTRIBUTES
 used to add more information corresponding to an HTML tag.
 Example:- <a href="https://codewithharry.com/"> Harry </a>

 we can either use single or double quotes in attribute

 The Heading tag is used to mark headings in html. from h1 to h6, we have tags for the most 
 important to the least important heading.
 Note:- we should not use HTML headings to make text thick or bold.
 <h1> Heading1 </h1>
 <h2> Heading2 </h2>
 <h3> Heading3 </h3>
 <h4> Heading4 </h4>
 <h5> Heading5 </h5>
 <h6> Heading6 </h6>

The Paragrapgh tag
Paragraph tags are used to add paragraph to an HTML page.
<p> This is a paragraph </p>

The Anchor tag
The anchor tag is used to add links to an existing content inside an HTML page.
<a href="https://codewithharry.com/"> Click here </a>

The img tag
img tag is used to add image in an HTML page.
<img src="image.jpeg"> (relative url of an image)

Bold, Italic and underline tags
We can use bold, italic and underline tags to highlight the text as follows.
<b> This is bold text </b>
<i> This is italic text </i>
<u> This is underline text </u>

br tag
the br tag is used to create line breaks in an HTML document.

big and small tags
we can make the text a bit larger and a bit smaller using big and small atgs respectively.

hr tag
<hr> tag in HTML is used to create a horizontal rules often used to separate the content

subscript & Superscript
we can add subscript and superscript in HTML as follows:
<sub> this </sub> is subscript
<sup>this</sup> is superscript

pre tag
HTML always ignores extra spaces and newlines. In order to display a piece of text as is, we use pre tag.
<pre> This is a pre tag </pre>
